The MVP
A web application with a single button. When clicked, it manually triggers a Two-Stage Scan workflow. The workflow reads a local background.md file for strategic context, performs the scan, and renders a structured JSON report of its findings on the front-end.

The OKRs:
* Objective: Deliver high-quality, relevant strategic alerts.
    * Key Result 1 (Precision): 100% of the news items flagged with High Importance in the final report must be directly related to the strategic goals defined in background.md.
    * Key Result 2 (Actionability): The final report must be a clean, structured JSON that is easy for a front-end to parse and display.
